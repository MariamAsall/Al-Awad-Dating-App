# Al-Awad-Dating-App
The Al-Awad Dating App project aimed to address prevalent issues within the dating app landscape, particularly within the Islamic world, by providing a platform that prioritized acceptance, user experience, and safety. Recognizing the challenges of misinformation, false profiles, and inadequate matching algorithms, the project sought to redefine the dating app experience. Through a meticulously designed SQL database, the system stored comprehensive user data, including demographics, interests, and preferences, facilitating precise matchmaking. The business requirements emphasized understanding the diverse Islamic market and implementing revenue streams through subscription-based services, admin functionalities, and HR management tools. The operational concept focused on seamless user registration, profile creation, advanced matching algorithms, and continuous improvement based on user feedback. Stakeholder requirements underscored the needs of subscribers, administrators, and HR personnel, emphasizing user-friendly interfaces, robust security measures, and privacy considerations. The system requirements detailed functional aspects like user registration, matching algorithms, and social integration, alongside non-functional requirements such as usability, security, and performance. The project integrated data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, mapping diagrams, and schemas to ensure a comprehensive and structured approach to database design and implementation. Overall, the Al-Awad Dating App project aimed to establish a trusted and inclusive platform, fostering meaningful connections while prioritizing user satisfaction, safety, and acceptance within the Islamic dating sphere
